1. You must be at least 18 years old to book and enter this agreement. Minors may ride only where permitted by law and only under the booking adult’s supervision and responsibility.
2. Provide accurate information and keep your account secure. You are responsible for activity on your account.
3. Government‑issued photo ID and payment card verification may be required at delivery.

 4) Rental Term, Delivery & Pickup

1. Rental time begins at Delivery Confirmation and ends at Pickup Confirmation.
2. Delivery and pickup occur within a scheduled window. You agree to be available or designate a safe handoff/secure drop location.
3. If we cannot deliver/pick up due to your unavailability, unsafe conditions, or restricted access, we may charge: (a) a redelivery/repickup fee, and (b) additional rental time until successful completion.
4. You must keep the e‑bike at the Delivery Address unless updated and approved in the app.
5. We may use telematics (e.g., location, lock status, battery level) for logistics, loss prevention, and support (see Privacy Policy).

 5) Fees, Payments & Deposits

1. You authorize charges to your payment method for rental fees, delivery/pickup, taxes, optional add‑ons, damages, loss/theft, cleaning, late return, and any other amounts described here.
2. A refundable security deposit/authorization hold may be placed at booking or delivery.

4. Cancellation: Free cancellations up to 48 before delivery window; afterwards a late‑cancel fee may apply.
5. Price list is shown at checkout and may change prospectively.

 6) Use of the E‑Bike

1. Follow all traffic laws and helmet requirements. We strongly recommend wearing a certified helmet at all times.
2. No riding under the influence of drugs/alcohol.
3. No passengers, towing, stunts, racing, off‑road, stairs, or commercial delivery unless expressly permitted in writing.
4. Weight limit: 250 lbs/kg.
5. Only the booking Rider and permitted guests under Rider’s supervision may use the e‑bike. No re‑renting or lending to unknown third parties.

The Service is provided “as is” and “as available.” We disclaim warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non‑infringement to the fullest extent permitted by law. Availability may be affected by weather, traffic, and operational factors.

 16) Return & Refund Policy

This Return & Refund Policy applies to all e-bike rentals serviced through our platform.

By finalizing payment for a rental, you acknowledge and agree to the following terms:

 - Upon confirmation of your booking and payment, 25% of the total rental fee is deemed non-refundable.

  Example: If your rental total is $100, $25 will not be refunded even if you cancel before delivery.

  b) Delivery Fees

  - Any applicable delivery fees are strictly non-refundable under all circumstances, regardless of cancellation timing.

c) Non-Refundable Events

- Once the delivery driver is within two (2) miles of the delivery location provided, OR
- Once the renter has taken possession of the e-bike through pickup,

then the full rental fee becomes non-refundable.

By completing your booking and payment, you expressly agree to the refund policy above.

 17) Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for lost profits, arising from or related to your use of the Service. Our total liability for any claim will not exceed the amounts you paid for the rental giving rise to the claim in the 6 months preceding the event.
